                Firstly, <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/degrees">find your degree (UoN)</a> and then navigate to the Program Handbook for your enrolled program.

                In this an example, we are looking for Bachelor of Information Technology.
                <img width="100%" src="Images/finddegrees.png" alt="program plan"/>
                Before enrolling check the plan for your program and the commencing semester and year. In this example we are looking to commence in semester 1 2020.
              </p>
              <img width="100%" src="Images/programplans.png" alt="program plan"/>
              <p>
                In the program plan, you can see the courses you are supposed to take relative to the semester. As an example, outlined below is the courses you have to take semester 1 of Bachelor of I.T.
              </p>
              <img width="100%" src="Images/programplan.png" alt="program plan"/>
              <p>
                To view specific information about the course, you can either click on the course links in the plan or take a look at this <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course">Course Handbook (UoN)</a> to find out information for each course.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notice you may not have all the courses filled in. That is because you have to choose certain courses depending on your program requirements or your preferred interests. These could be
                Major Compulsory, Directed or Elective courses. Refer to the Program Plan to see the unit requirements and courses you can take to fill in the gaps in your plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have figured out the courses you need to take in the semester you intend to enrol in. UoN has a handy <a href="https://spprd.newcastle.edu.au/scientia/timetable.html">course timetable tool (UoN)</a> which you can use to find times for your lectures and labs for your courses. 
              </p>
                <img width="100%" src="images/timetabletool.png"/> 
              <p>
                It is recommended that you choose at least 2 lab times as they can fill up fast. Note down the times in your weekly planner. 
              </p>
                <img width="100%" src="images/classtimes.png"/>
              <p>When enrolment opens you will be able to enrol online through myHub. Follow this <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/study/new-students/enrolment">enrolment guide (UoN)</a> for assistance.</p>

                  Firstly, have a list of the courses you wish to enrol in handy, then go to <a href="https://myhub.newcastle.edu.au/">myHub</a>. Once there click on the Course Enrolment card shown here:
                  <img width="100%" src="Images/myhub-course-select.png" alt="Course select"/></br></br>
                  Once in the my Course Enrolment page click the "Add Courses" tab on the left of the page.
                </p>
                <img width="100%" src="Images/myhub-course-add.png" alt="Course add"/></br></br>
                <p>
                  click on the Find Courses button to take you through to the next page.
                </p>
                <img width="100%" src="Images/myhub-course-find.png" alt="Course select"/></br></br>
                <p>
                  Make sure you enter all of the information for the courses you want to enrol in, this is where having a list of your courses written down comes in handy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 the easiest way to search for courses is to have the exact course ID and input that into the fields, making sure that you choose the correct campus you wish to study at. 
                 You don't want to enrol in the wrong campus and miss out on your prefered class alocation times later on. An example of course searching is found below:
                </p>
                <img width="100%" src="Images/myhub-course-search.png" alt="Course select"/></br></br>
                <p>
                  Once you have input the course information and clicked search there should be a list of one or more courses, again make sure that you have the correct campus location when selecting them. 
                  If there are no results check whether the course is available in Semester 1 or Semester 2 on the course page, if you have the correct semester you may have input the wrong code double check. 
                  If you are still having problems seek further help from: <a href="https://askuon.newcastle.edu.au/">AskUON</a>, <a href="https://askuon.newcastle.edu.au/">Student Central</a>, or email the <a href="studentadvice@newcastle.edu.au">Student Progress Advice</a> team.</br></br>
                  Click on the correct course and location as in the example below:
                </p>
                  <img width="100%" src="images/myhub-course-search-result.png"/></br></br>
                <p>
                  Complete the first steps up until here with will your courses. Once you have done this wait for around 30 minutes and then proceed to 
                  <a href="https://myuon.newcastle.edu.au/campusm/home#menu">myUON</a> on either the mobile app or desktop. and click on the "myTimetable" card.
                </p>
                  <img width="100%" src="images/myUON-myTimetable.png"/></br></br>
                <p>
                  On this page you should see a list of your enrolled courses with either "Not Allocated" or "Pending" next to them, make sure you go through and select your prefered date and time with each class that is labeled "Not Allocated"
                  avoiding any clashes where possible. 
                  <img width="100%" src="images/myUON-myTimetable-prefs.png"/></br></br>
                  If your classes are not shown in the enrolment section try waiting another 10 or so minutes, if they still don't show check your myhub and see if you are enrolled in them there. If there is nothing
                  seemingly wrong with your enrollment on myHub seek futher assistance from <a href="https://askuon.newcastle.edu.au/">AskUON</a>, <a href="https://askuon.newcastle.edu.au/">Student Central</a>, or email the <a href="studentadvice@newcastle.edu.au">Student Progress Advice</a> team.
                  With that all you have to do now is wait until your classes are allocated!

                For the majority of students, they will be enrolling to Semester 1 and 2 in an academic year. A semester is made up of 13 weeks, including a mid-semester break and concluding with an exam period. <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/dates">Please refer to this page for key university dates (UoN).</a>

              <h4>1. Enrolment</h4>
              <p>
                Your first task as a new student is to find out what courses you need to enrol in. You can check out the guide to choosing courses in the 'Getting Started' section of the Orientation. A full-time enrolment
                requires a minimum of 30 units for domestic students and 40 units for international students unless otherwise approved. Part-time enrolment entails 10-20 units of study per semester. Given those details, you 
                have to decide what courses you should enrol in. Once you are certain about the courses you're choosing, please <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/study/new-students/enrolment">follow this guide to MyHub online enrolment (UoN)</a>.
              </p>
              <h4>2. Orientation</h4>
              <p>
                In the week prior to the commencement of your first semester, you can attend the orientation to gain helpful insight to the university lifestyle. Orientation lasts all week but you will have a dedicated day followed by
                information and activities. This is a fantastic oppurtunity to meet staff and students in the same degree and familiarise yourself with the campus locations.
                There is also plenty of social events, free food, entertainment and giveaways! However, if you can't make it, don't stress out. This website has all the information you need to get ready for uni.
              </p>
              <h4>3. First Weeks</h4>
              <p>
                It's important to utilize the the time you get in your first weeks of university to assimilate the university culture and your study schedule. Study the Course Outline for your courses and make a plan for completing the assessments.
                The relationships you form in your first weeks and the sooner you start to make progress in your coursework will lead to better success throughout your first semester. There are plenty of study resources the university offers for students to thrive in their studies, which you can learn about in this website. 
              </p>
              <h4>4. Engage With Social Activities</h4>
              <p>
               It's not just all study and no free time! it's important that you find a balance between your studies and social life. The university has various events taking place
                throughout the semester including art exhibitions, free BBQ, movies, live music and performances on campus at the bars and communical outdoor spaces. You can also join a club or society, which is a fantastic
                way to meet new friends and get involved in campus life. There is a wide range of clubs from sporting, cultural and social etc. that covers a large spectrum of different interests. Visit the Social page, or attend the Orientation Expo to learn more!

              <h4>7. Uni Break</h4>
              <p>
                Every semester there is approximately a 2 week-long break that takes place mid-way through the semester. This break is a great time to relax, catch up on studies you may have fell behind in or work on upcoming assignments. It is advised that you don't <em>totally</em> take a break from studies for 2 weeks as enticing as it seems. Utilizing this 
                time for a strategic advantage in completing your final assessments would be the smartest move. It's important to destress though and not push yourself too hard. Maybe take studies in smaller steps and take longer breaks than you typically would.
              </p>
              <h4>7. Final Assessment</h4>
              <p>
                The final weeks of the university is arguably the most critical time of the semester. During this period, students are typically hard at work to get their final assesments done, which tend to make up a crucial part of their final result. Good time management is very important
                as you may need to balance time between your different course assignments. It is advised that you aim to finish the assignment a week before it's due, that way you have time to resolve any potential setbacks.

              <p>
                The exam period takes place after the final week of studies of the semester. This will depend on the courses you take whether they have examination assessments or not.
