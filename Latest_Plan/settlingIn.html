              <h3>Active Travel</h3>
              <p>
                Active travel focuses on physical activity (walking, cycling, scooters, skateboards and the use of public transport) as your transport mode, which offers a range of great health, financial and environmental benefits.
                Active travel options are some of the most efficient and effective ways to incorporate regular exercise into your daily life. And with showers, lockers and secure bicycle storage located in the Bike Hubs, 9 you can be active and still feel fresh for class. The Hubs are free and can be accessed with your student card, with two located at Newcastle (Callaghan) and one at Newcastle City.
                To support a healthier University community we have put together a range of Active Travel Guides to consider when looking at your travel options.

              <h3>Drive and Park</h3>
              <p>
                With the campus spread out over 140 hectares of natural bushland, it’s a good idea to arrive early and give yourself plenty of time to walk from your parking space to your destination.
                You can buy a full year or six-month parking permit from the University’s online shop and collect it from Student Central. Otherwise buy a daily parking ticket from the machines around campus. The machines do not give change but do take paywave, Apple and Samsung Pay. Find designated free parking and free motorcycle parking areas on the campus maps. Disabled parking bays are for RMS Mobility holders only.
                You must park in designated “General” parking areas only. Parking in staff or reserved parking or on landscaped areas will attract a hefty fine. There is free parking for motorcycles in the designated bays.

              <h3>Park and Ride</h3>
              <p>
                A free shuttle bus for staff and students runs from Callaghan to Newcastle City campus. The shuttle bus operates 5 days a week from 7am – 10:15pm, usually every 30 mins. 
                You can use this service to travel between classes all you need is your student ID card. To see the timetable and pick-up points
